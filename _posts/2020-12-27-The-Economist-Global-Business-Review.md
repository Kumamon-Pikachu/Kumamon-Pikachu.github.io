## 熄灯之时_When the lights go out

- 卫星数据对朝鲜不透明的经济提供了新的解读

> A new report made from satellite statistics indicates that…

> Satellite data **shed new light on** North Korea's opaque economy.

 

- 一个被韩国、中国和俄罗斯的耀眼光芒环绕的深渊，没有任何东西可从中逃脱。

> An abyss surrounded by the shining of South Korea, China and Russia, nothing can escape.

> An abyss, ringed by the brilliant glow of South Korea, China and Russia, from which nothing can escape.

 

- 但是轨道卫星还是探测到了这个隐士王国散发出的一些光线。

> However, our orbit satellites still have detected some lights form the hiden kingdom.

> But the Hermit Kingdom does emit a bit of light, which orbiting satellites detect.

 

- 有关朝鲜的可靠信息来源很少，夜间照明亮度是其中之一。

> There is very little authentic information about North Korea, night light is one of it.

> And nocturnal luminosity is one of the few reliable sources of information about the country.

 

- 从目前的照明亮度看，朝鲜的经济比人们之前所想的更贫穷、更不稳定、更容易受天气影响。

> As we can see from the luminosity, North Korea's economy is more poor, unstable and easily affected by weather.

> It implies that North Korea’s economy is poorer, more volatile and more vulnerable to weather than formerly thought.

 

- 夜间灯光数据是经济活动的有力指标。

> The data of nocturnal luminosity is a dynamic index of economy activities.

> Night lights are a strong proxy for economic activity.

 

- 没有哪个国家的可靠经济数据比朝鲜更少。

> North Korea’s economy statistic data is less than any other countries in the world.

> Nowhere are good economic data rarer than in North Korea.

 

- 国际制裁不太可能是亮度下降的原因。

> International sanctions might not be the reason … of lights.

> International sanctions are unlikely to have produced this darkening.

 

- 煤炭等朝鲜出口产品价格下跌可能起到了一定作用。

> The decline of coal price has made some consequence.

> A drop in the prices of North Korean exports, like coal, may have **played a part.**

 

- 经济缩水程度可能没有照明亮度的降幅那么大。

> The economy may not have shrunk as much as the dimming suggests.
